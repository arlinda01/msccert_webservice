      "q1": {
        "question": "How long does the ISO certification process take?",
        "answer": "The duration depends on the company size (units to be certified, number of employees) and process complexity. In practice, the audit team needs at minimum several days but also weeks of work."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "How much does ISO certification cost?",
        "answer": "The certification price depends on the type or ISO systems you want to integrate (a single standard or several integrated standards together). Their complexity combined with the duration of the audit process determines the monetary value."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Does MSC Certifications offer consultancy to implement ISO?",
        "answer": "No. MSC Certifications, as a certification body, does not offer consultancy for implementing management systems for its clients, to maintain impartiality and compliance with ISO/IEC 17021 requirements. We can explain standard requirements and audit findings, but not build the system for you."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Does MSC Certifications offer integrated audits for multiple standards simultaneously?",
        "answer": "Yes. When reasonable and possible, we combine auditing of multiple standards into an integrated audit, to avoid duplication and reduce the operational burden for the client."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "Can I transfer my certificate from another certification body?",
        "answer": "Yes, MSC Certifications can accept certificate transfers from other accredited bodies, if certain conditions are met (validity of existing certificate, nonconformity status, audit documentation, etc.). The transfer process is evaluated case by case."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "Can the audit be conducted remotely (online)?",
        "answer": "Yes, in some cases and according to accreditation rules, part of the audit can be conducted remotely, especially for documentation review. Critical on-site activities require physical presence."
